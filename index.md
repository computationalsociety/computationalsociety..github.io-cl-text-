## About This Book

This website is part of the book  
**_Introduction to Computational Linguistics_**  
by **Muhammad Shoaib Tahir**.

The material is designed for readers from linguistics and related disciplines who wish to understand computational approaches to language **without heavy mathematical formalism**. The focus is on intuition, conceptual clarity, and practical understanding.

## Scope and Philosophy

The chapters emphasize:

- Linguistic intuition over formal derivation  
- Conceptual explanations of probabilistic and computational models  
- Visual reasoning through figures and diagrams  
- Accessibility for non-mathematical readers  

---

## Chapters

### Chapter 5
- **[Mathematical Intuition for Language Processing](chapter5.html)**  
  Understanding frequency, probability, smoothing, and vector representations through intuitive explanations and visual examples.

---

## Interactive Demonstrations

The following interactive demos accompany specific chapters of the book and are intended to make abstract concepts concrete through hands-on exploration.

- **[Word Embedding Similarity Demo](demos/embeddings.html)**  
  Explore how words are represented as vectors and how similarity is computed in embedding space  
  *(Related to Chapter 5: Mathematical Intuition for Language Processing)*

- **[Morphology and Word Formation Demo](demos/preprocessing.html)**  
  Interactive illustration of normalization, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and basic word formation  
  *(Related to Chapter 7: Morphology and Word Formation)*
