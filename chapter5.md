## 5. Mathematical Intuition for Language Processing

For many students, mathematics is the most intimidating aspect of Computational Linguistics. This difficulty often arises not from the ideas themselves, but from how they are presented. In practice, mathematics in language processing serves to formalize intuitions that linguists already use informally.

This chapter introduces core mathematical ideas with an emphasis on interpretation and intuition rather than formal derivation.

### 5.1 Why Mathematics Appears in Language Processing

Language is uncertain, variable, and large-scale. Computational systems must reason about preference, expectation, and likelihood. Mathematics provides a precise framework for expressing these intuitions.

This figure shows how intuitive linguistic notions such as frequency and similarity correspond to mathematical representations such as counts and vectors.

### 5.2 Counting and Frequencies

Many computational approaches begin with simple counting. Frequency information allows systems to prioritize common patterns while still allowing rare forms to exist.

This figure illustrates that a small number of words occur very frequently, while most words occur rarely.

### 5.3 Probability as Uncertainty

Probability provides a way to model uncertainty in language. Instead of committing to a single interpretation, probabilistic models maintain multiple ranked possibilities.

The figure demonstrates how models assign different likelihoods to possible continuations.

### 5.4 Conditional Probability and Context

Conditional probability captures how context influences expectations. Linguistic predictions depend strongly on surrounding words.

This figure shows how probability mass shifts depending on contextual cues.

### 5.5 Why Zero Is a Problem

Language data is sparse. Treating unseen events as impossible causes models to fail on new input.

**Figure 5.5: The Zero-Probability Problem**

![Figure 5.5: The Zero-Probability Problem](figures/fig5.5.png)

The figure contrasts failure under zero probability with successful generalization using smoothing.

### 5.6 Log Probabilities Explained Simply

Probabilities for long sequences become extremely small. Log probabilities transform multiplication into addition, improving numerical stability.

<a id="fig5-6"></a>
**Figure 5.6: Probability Multiplication vs. Log Probability Addition**

![Figure 5.6: Probability Multiplication vs. Log Probability Addition](figures/fig5.6.png)

This transformation is computationally motivated and does not change the underlying interpretation.

### 5.7 Vectors as Linguistic Representations

Modern models represent linguistic units as vectors encoding contextual information.

**Figure 5.7: Word Vectors as Feature Containers**

![Figure 5.7: Word Vectors as Feature Containers](figures/fig5.7.png)

Vectors allow systems to capture graded similarity rather than rigid categories.

Distance between vectors reflects similarity in meaning or usage.

### Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced the mathematical intuition underlying language processing, focusing on counting, probability, smoothing, and representation. Mathematics is presented not as abstract formalism, but as a practical tool for modeling linguistic uncertainty and similarity.
